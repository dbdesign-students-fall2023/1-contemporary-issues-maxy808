# Tiktok's data harvesting: different view points on potential TikTok ban
In this document, I discuss two articles about Tiktok's potential threat on harvesting personal information of users.

## Article 1
In [TikTok has been accused of ‘aggressive’ data harvesting. Is your information at risk?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/19/tiktok-has-been-accused-of-aggressive-data-harvesting-is-your-information-at-risk), the author describes how TikTok collect users' data and raised concern among users.

Since TikTok is owned by Chinese internet company, it is great concern that if China could access data from users, especially when users are involved in something more sensitive. There is a suggestion that users should be more cautious about level of permissions shared with the app. Also, for users' safety, many people argue that TikTok should be banned or under strict regulation and operation.

## Article 2
While article 1 generally talks about why people support banning TikTok or make TikTok under strict regulation, article 2 has a different viewpoint: [‘Benefits outweigh the harm’: Worried about their livelihood, small business owners push back on potential TikTok ban](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/worried-about-their-livelihood-small-business-owners-push-back-on-potential-tiktok-ban.html)

In this article, the author shows opinions from small business owners on Tiktok and explains why they think the short-video app should stay. Without TikTok, small business owners would be at risk of losing income. TikTok is a great platform for users to explore new small businesses and provide business owners with new marketing strategies. The owners are also considering expanding to other platforms to mitigate the risk for solely relying on TikTok.
